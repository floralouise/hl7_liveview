# Hl7Liveview

This project uses LiveView with the Elixir Hl7 library: https://github.com/HCA-Healthcare/elixir-hl7.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser and use the menu to navigate the views.
